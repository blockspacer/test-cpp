# Notes

# Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns

# Open Closed Principle
- Specification pattern
- open for extension, closed for modification

# Liskov Substitution Principle
- put a derived class anywhere where base class is used and not break the function/code

# Interface Segregetion Principle
- avoid stuffing too much into an interface

# Dependency Inversion Principle
- high level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions
- Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions
- depend on abstractions not on details
