# Metaprograming

## Type Functions 
- basically templated `c++` `structs`/`classes` with member type aliases (using statements or typedefs)

## Type Predicates
- a `type predicate` is a templated function that returns `bool`
- can be implemented as either a `constexpr` function
- or as a struct with member type aliases
